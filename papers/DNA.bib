	Abstract = {RAID-II is a high-bandwidth, network-attached storage server designed and implemented at the University of California at Berkeley. In this paper, we measure the performance of RAID-II and evaluate various architectural decisions made during the design process. We first measure the end-to-end performance of the system to be approximately 20 MB/s for both disk array reads and writes. We then perform a bottleneck analysis by examining the performance of each individual subsystem and conclude that the disk subsystem limits performance. By adding a custom interconnect board with a high-speed memory and bus system and parity engine, we are able to achieve a performance speedup of 8 to 15 over a comparative system using only off-the-shelf hardware.},

abstract = {In 1989, the RAID (Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks) group at U. C. Berkeley built a prototype disk array called RAID-I. The bandwidth delivered to clients by RAID-I was severely limited by the memory system bandwidth of the disk array' s host workstation. We designed our second prototype, RAID-H, to deliver more of the disk array bandwidth to file server clients. A custom-built crossbar memory system called the XBUS board connects the disks directly to the high-speed network, allowing data for large requests to bypass the server workstation. RAID-II runs Log-Structured File System (LFS) software to optimize performance for bandwidth-intensive applications.The RAID-II hardware with a single XBUS controller board delivers 20 megabytes/second for large, random read operations and up to 31 megabytes/second for sequential read operations. A preliminary implementation of LFS on RAID-II delivers 21 megabytes/second on large read requests and 15 megabytes/second on large write operations.},

  Networks with higher bit-error rates, such as those with wireless
  links and mobile hosts, violate many of the assumptions made by
  TCP, causing degraded end-to-end performance. In tbis paper, we
  describe the design and implementation of a simple protocol, called
  the snoop protocol, that improves TCP performance in wireless
  networks. The protocol modifies network-layer software mainly at a
  base station and preserves end-to-end TCP semantics. The main idea
  of the protocol is to cache packets at the base station and perform
  local retransmissions across the wireless link. We have implemented
  the snoop protocol on a wireless testbed consisting of IBM ThinkPad
  laptops and i486 base stations communicating over an AT&amp;T
  Wavelan. Our experiments show that it is significantly more robust
  at dealing with unreliable wireless links as compared to normal
  TCP; we have achieved throughput speedups of up to 20 times over
  regular TCP in our experiments with the protocol.},

	abstract = {TCP is a reliable transport protocol tuned to perform well in traditional networks where congestion is the primary cause of packet loss. However, networks with wireless links and mobile hosts incur significant losses due to bit-errors and handoffs. This environment violates many of the assumptions made by TCP, causing degraded end-to-end performance. In this paper, we describe the additions and modifications to the standard Internet protocol stack (TCP/IP) to improve end-to-end reliable transport performance in mobile environments. The protocol changes are made to network-layer software at the base station and mobile host, and preserve the end-to-end semantics of TCP. One part of the modifications, called the snoop module, caches packets at the base station and performs local retransmissions across the wireless link to alleviate the problems caused by high bit-error rates. The second part is a routing protocol that enables low-latency handoff to occur with negligible data loss. We have implemented this new protocol stack on a wireless testbed. Our experiments show that this system is significantly more robust at dealing with unreliable wireless links than normal TCP; we have achieved throughput speedups of up to 20 times over regular TCP and handoff latencies over 10 times shorter than other mobile routing protocols.},

abstract = {Reliable transport protocols such as TCP are tuned to perform well in traditional networks where packet losses occur mostly because of congestion. However, networks with wireless and other lossy links also suffer from significant non-congestion-related losses due to reasons such as bit errors and handoffs. TCP responds to all losses by invoking congestion control and avoidance algorithms, resulting in degraded end-to-end performance in wireless and lossy systems. In this paper, we compare several schemes designed to improve the performance of TCP in such networks. These schemes are classified into three broad categories: end-to-end protocols, where the sender is aware of the wireless link; link-layer protocols, that provide local reliability; and split-connection protocols, that break the end-to-end connection into two parts at the base station. We present the results of several experiments performed in both LAN and WAN environments, using throughput and goodput as the metrics for comparison.Our results show that a reliable link-layer protocol with some knowledge of TCP provides very good performance. Furthermore, it is possible to achieve good performance without splitting the end-to-end connection at the base station. We also demonstrate that selective acknowledgments and explicit loss notifications result in significant performance improvements.},

abstract = {The Internet is a very large scale, complex, dynamical system that is hard to model and analyze. In this paper, we develop and analyze statistical models for the observed end-to-end network performance based on extensive packet-level traces (consisting of approximately 1.5 billion packets) collected from the primary Web site for the Atlanta Summer Olympic Games in 1996. We find that observed mean throughputs for these transfers measured over 60 million complete connections vary widely as a function of end-host location and time of day, confirming that the Internet is characterized by a large degree of heterogeneity. Despite this heterogeneity, we find (using best-fit linear regression techniques) that we can express the throughput for Web transfers to most hosts as a random variable with a log-normal distribution. Then, using observed throughput as the control parameter, we attempt to quantify the spatial (statistical similarity across neighboring hosts) and temporal (persistence over time) stability of network performance. We find that Internet hosts that are close to each other often have almost identically distributed probability distributions of throughput. We also find that throughputs to individual hosts often do not change appreciably for several minutes. Overall, these results indicate that there is promise in protocol mechanisms that cache and share network characteristics both within a single host and amongst nearby hosts.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel framework for managing network congestion from an end-to-end perspective. Our work is motivated by trends in traffic patterns that threaten the long-term stability of the Internet. These trends include the use of multiple independent concurrent flows by Web applications and the increasing use of transport protocols and applications that do not adapt to congestion. We present an end-system architecture centered around a Congestion Manager (CM) that ensures proper congestion behavior and allows applications to easily adapt to network congestion. Our framework integrates congestion management across all applications and transport protocols. The CM maintains congestion parameters and exposes an API to enable applications to learn about network characteristics, pass information to the CM, and schedule data transmissions. Internally, it uses a window-based control algorithm, a scheduler to regulate transmissions, and a lightweight protocol to elicit feedback from receivers.We describe how TCP and an adaptive real-time streaming audio application can be implemented using the CM. Our simulation results show that an ensemble of concurrent TCP connections can effectively share bandwidth and obtain consistent performance, without adversely affecting other network flows. Our results also show that the CM enables audio applications to adapt to congestion conditions without having to perform congestion control or bandwidth probing on their own. We conclude that the CM provides a useful and pragmatic framework for building adaptive Internet applications.},

abstract = {This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of an operating system module, the Congestion Manager (CM), which provides integrated network flow management and exports a convenient programming interface that allows applications to be notified of, and adapt to, changing network conditions. We describe the API by which applications interface with the CM, and the architectural considerations that factored into the design. To evaluate the architecture and API, we describe our implementations of TCP; a streaming layered audio/video application; and an interactive audio application using the CM, and show that they achieve adaptive behavior without incurring much end-system overhead. All flows including TCP benefit from the sharing of congestion information, and applications are able to incorporate new functionality such as congestion control and adaptive behavior.},

abstract = {Compressing protocol headers has traditionally been an attractive way of conserving bandwidth over low-speed links, including those in wireless systems. However, despite the growth in recent years in the number of end-to-end protocols beyond TCP/IP, header compression deployment for those protocols has not kept pace. This is in large part due to complexities in implementation, which often requires a detailed knowledge of kernel internals, and a lack of a common way of pursuing the general problem across a variety of end-to-end protocols. To address this, rather than defining several new protocol-specific standards, we present a unified framework for header compression. This framework includes a simple, platform-independent header description language that protocol implementors can use to describe high-level header properties, and a platform-specific code generation tool that produces kernel source code automatically from this header specification. Together, the high-level description language and code generator free protocol designers from having to understand any details of the target platform, enabling them to implement header compression with relatively little effort. We analyze the performance of compression produced using this framework for TCP/IP in the Linux 2.0 kernel and demonstrate that unified, automatically-generated header compression without significant performance penalty is viable.},

abstract = {In response to the serious scalability and deployment concerns with IP Multicast, we and other researchers have advocated an alternate architecture for supporting group communication applications over the Internet where all multicast functionality is pushed to the edge. We refer to such an architecture as End System Multicast. While End System Multicast has several potential advantages, a key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a design. While preliminary simulation results conducted in static environments are promising, they have yet to consider the challenging performance requirements of real world applications in a dynamic and heterogeneous Internet environment.In this paper, we explore how Internet environments and application requirements can influence End System Multicast design. We explore these issues in the context of audio and video conferencing: an important class of applications with stringent performance requirements. We conduct an extensive evaluation study of schemes for constructing overlay networks on a wide-area test-bed of about twenty hosts distributed around the Internet. Our results demonstrate that it is important to adapt to both latency and bandwidth while constructing overlays optimized for conferencing applications. Further, when relatively simple techniques are incorporated into current self-organizing protocols to enable dynamic adaptation to latency and bandwidth, the performance benefits are significant. Our results indicate that End System Multicast is a promising architecture for enabling performance-demanding conferencing applications in a dynamic and heterogeneous Internet environment.},

abstract = {WWW workload generators are used to evaluate web server performance, and thus have a large impact on what performance optimizations are applied to servers. However, current benchmarks ignore a crucial component: how these servers perform in the environment in which they are intended to be used, namely the wide-area Internet.This paper shows how WAN conditions can affect WWW server performance. We examine these effects using an experimental test-bed which emulates WAN characteristics in a live setting, by introducing factors such as delay and packet loss in a controlled and reproducible fashion. We study how these factors interact with the host TCP implementation and what influence they have on web server performance. We demonstrate that when more realistic wide-area conditions are introduced, servers exhibit very different performance properties and scaling behaviors, which are not exposed by existing benchmarks running on LANs. We show that observed throughputs can give misleading information about server performance, and thus find that maximum throughput, or capacity, is a more useful metric. We find that packet losses can reduce server capacity by as much as 50 percent and increase response time as seen by the client. We show that using TCP SACK can reduce client response time, without reducing server capacity.},

abstract = {Recently, several proposals have been made for sharing congestion information across concurrent flows between end-systems. In these proposals, the granularity for sharing has ranged from all flows to a common host to all hosts on a shared LAN. While these proposals have been successful at ensuring sound AIMD behavior of the aggregate of flows, they suffer from what we term "false sharing". False sharing occurs when two or more flows sharing congestion state may, in fact, not share the same bottleneck.In this work, we investigate the effects of false sharing on shared congestion management schemes. We characterize the origins of false sharing into two distinct cases: (i) networks with QoS enhancements such as differentiated services, where a flow classifier segregates flows into different queues, and (ii) networks with path diversity where different flows to the same destination address are routed differently --- a situation that occurs in dispersity routing, load-balancing, and with network address translators (NATs). We evaluate the impact of false sharing on flow performance and consider whether it might cause a bottleneck link to become persistently overloaded. We propose schemes for detecting false sharing and show how different metrics (loss rate, delay distribution, and reordering) compare for this purpose. We also consider the issue of how a sender should respond when it detects false sharing.},

abstract = {For years, the conventional wisdom [7, 22] has been that the continued stability of the Internet depends on the widespread deployment of "socially responsible" congestion control. In this paper, we seek to answer the following fundamental question: If network end-points behaved in a selfish manner, would the stability of the Internet be endangered?.We evaluate the impact of greedy end-point behavior through a game-theoretic analysis of TCP. In this "TCP Game" each flowattempts to maximize the throughput it achieves by modifying its congestion control behavior. We use a combination of analysis and simulation to determine the Nash Equilibrium of this game. Our question then reduces to whether the network operates efficiently at these Nash equilibria.Our findings are twofold. First, in more traditional environments -- where end-points use TCP Reno-style loss recovery and routers use drop-tail queues -- the Nash Equilibria are reasonably efficient. However, when endpoints use more recent variations of TCP (e.g., SACK) and routers employ either RED or drop-tail queues, the Nash equilibria are very inefficient. This suggests that the Internet of the past could remain stable in the face of greedy end-user behavior, but the Internet of today is vulnerable to such behavior. Second, we find that restoring the efficiency of the Nash equilibria in these settings does not require heavy-weight packet scheduling techniques (e.g., Fair Queuing) but instead can be done with a very simple stateless mechanism based on CHOKe [21].},

For example, rate of mobility, quality of wireless communication, density of communicating nodes, power constraints and computational constraints all vary greatly from situation to situation. Unfortunately, existing routing protocols, transport protocols and adaptive applications can only adapt in a limited way. One feature that is missing from many systems is the ability to identify gross operating conditions and take on very different modes of operation. Such adaptability would improve the efficiency of many solutions. We use the term multi-modal protocols to describe systems that adapt in this way. We have explored two such systems: Wireless TCP and Overlay Routing.},

As these links are upgraded, however, it is important to consider where new bottlenecks and hot-spots are likely to arise. In this paper, we address this question through an investigation of non-access bottlenecks. These are links within carrier ISPs or between neighboring carriers that could potentially constrain the bandwidth available to long-lived TCP flows. Through an extensive measurement study, we discover, classify, and characterize bottleneck links (primarily in the U.S.) in terms of their location, latency, and available capacity.We find that about 50\% of the Internet paths explored have a non-access bottleneck with available capacity less than 50 Mbps, many of which limit the performance of well-connected nodes on the Internet today. Surprisingly, the bottlenecks identified are roughly equally split between intra-ISP links and peering links between ISPs. Also, we find that low-latency links, both intra-ISP and peering, have a significant likelihood of constraining available bandwidth. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings on related issues such as choosing an access provider and optimizing routes through the network. We believe that these results could be valuable in guiding the design of future network services, such as overlay routing, in terms of which links or paths to avoid (and how to avoid them) in order to improve performance.},

abstract = {As the Internet grows in size, it becomes crucial to understand how the speeds of links in the network must improve in order to sustain the pressure of new end-nodes being added each day. Although the speeds of links in the core and at the edges roughly improve according to Moore's law, this improvement alone might not be enough. Indeed, the structure of the Internet graph and routing in the network might necessitate much faster improvements in the speeds of key links in the network.In this paper, using a combination of analysis and extensive simulations, we show that the worst congestion in the Internet in fact scales poorly with the network size (n1+Ω(1), where n is the number of nodes), when shortest-path routing is used. We also show, somewhat surprisingly, that policy-based routing does not exacerbate the maximum congestion when compared to shortest-path routing.Our results show that it is crucial to identify ways to alleviate this congestion to avoid some links from being perpetually congested. To this end, we show that the congestion scaling properties of the Internet graph can be improved dramatically by introducing moderate amounts of redundancy in the graph in terms of parallel edges between pairs of adjacent nodes.},

abstract = {Multihoming has traditionally been employed by stub networks to enhance the reliability of their network connectivity. With the advent of commercial "intelligent route control" products, stubs now leverage multihoming to improve performance. Although multihoming is widely used for reliability and, increasingly for performance, not much is known about the tangible benefits that multihoming can offer, or how these benefits can be fully exploited. In this paper, we aim to quantify the extent to which multihomed networks can leverage performance and reliability benefits from connections to multiple providers. We use data collected from servers belonging to the Akamai content distribution network to evaluate performance benefits from two distinct perspectives of multihoming: high-volume content-providers which transmit large volumes of data to many distributed clients, and enterprises which primarily receive data from the network. In both cases, we find that multihoming can improve performance significantly and that not choosing the right set of providers could result in a performance penalty as high as 40\%. We also find evidence of diminishing returns in performance when more than four providers are considered for multihoming. In addition, using a large collection of measurements, we provide an analysis of the reliability benefits of multihoming. Finally, we provide guidelines on how multihomed networks can choose ISPs, and discuss practical strategies of using multiple upstream connections to achieve optimal performance benefits.},

Through an extensive measurement study, we discover, classify and characterize non-access bottleneck links in terms of their location, latency and available capacity. We find that nearly half of the paths explored have a non-access bottleneck with available capacity less than 50 Mbps. The bottlenecks identified are roughly equally split between intra-ISP links and links between ISPs. These results have implications on issues such as the choice of access providers and route optimization.},

abstract = {Webcams, microphones, pressure gauges and other sensors provide exciting new opportunities for querying and monitoring the physical world. In this paper we focus on querying wide area sensor databases, containing (XML) data derived from sensors spread over tens to thousands of miles. We present the first scalable system for executing XPATH queries on such databases. The system maintains the logical view of the data as a single XML document, while physically the data is fragmented across any number of host nodes. For scalability, sensor data is stored close to the sensors, but can be cached elsewhere as dictated by the queries. Our design enables self starting distributed queries that jump directly to the lowest common ancestor of the query result, dramatically reducing query response times. We present a novel query-evaluate gather technique (using XSLT) for detecting (1) which data in a local database fragment is part of the query result, and (2) how to gather the missing parts. We define partitioning and cache invariants that ensure that even partial matches on cached data are exploited and that correct answers are returned, despite our dynamic query-driven caching. Experimental results demonstrate that our techniques dramatically increase query throughputs and decrease query response times in wide area sensor databases.},

IrisNet exploits the fact that high-volume sensor feeds are typically attached to devices with significant computing power and storage, and running a standard operating system. It uses aggressive filtering, smart query routing, and semantic caching to dramatically reduce network bandwidth utilization and improve query response times, as we demonstrate.Our demo will present two services built on Iris-Net, from two very different application domains. The first one, a parking space finder, utilizes webcams that monitor parking spaces to answer queries such as the availability of parking spaces near a user's destination. The second one, a distributed infrastructure monitor, uses measurement tools installed in individual nodes of a large distributed infrastructure to answer queries such as average network bandwidth usage of a set of nodes.},

abstract = {As the Internet grows in size, it becomes crucial to understand how the speeds of links in the network must improve in order to sustain the pressure of new end-nodes being added each day. Although the speeds of links in the core and at the edges improve roughly according to Moore's law, this improvement alone might not be enough. Indeed, the structure of the Internet graph and routing in the network might necessitate much faster improvements in the speeds of key links in the network.In this paper, using a combination of analysis and extensive simulations, we show that the worst congestion in the Internet AS-level graph in fact scales poorly with the network size (<i>n</i><sup>1+ω(1)</sup>, where <i>n</i> is the number of nodes), when shortest-path routing is used to route traffic between ASes. We also show, somewhat surprisingly, that policy-based routing <i>does not</i> exacerbate the maximum congestion when compared to shortest-path routing.Our results show that it is crucial to identify ways to alleviate this congestion to avoid some links from being perpetually congested. To this end, we show that the congestion scaling properties of Internet-like graphs can be improved dramatically by introducing moderate amounts of redundancy in the graph in terms of parallel edges between pairs of adjacent nodes.},

abstract = {The limitations of BGP routing in the Internet are often blamed for poor end-to-end performance and prolonged connectivity interruptions. Recent work advocates using overlays to effectively bypass BGP's path selection in order to improve performance and fault tolerance. In this paper, we explore the possibility that intelligent control of BGP routes, coupled with ISP multihoming, can provide competitive end-to-end performance and reliability. Using extensive measurements of paths between nodes in a large content distribution network, we compare the relative benefits of overlay routing and multihoming route control in terms of round-trip latency, TCP connection throughput, and path availability. We observe that the performance achieved by route control together with multihoming to three ISPs (3-multihoming), is within 5-15% of overlay routing employed in conjunction 3-multihoming, in terms of both end-to-end RTT and throughput. We also show that while multihoming cannot offer the nearly perfect resilience of overlays, it can eliminate almost all failures experienced by a singly-homed end-network. Our results demonstrate that, by leveraging the capability of multihoming route control, it is not necessary to circumvent BGP routing to extract good wide-area performance and availability from the existing routing system.},

Mercury differs from previous range-based query systems in that it supports multiple attributes as well as performs explicit load balancing. To guarantee efficient routing and load balancing, Mercury uses novel light-weight sampling mechanisms for uniformly sampling random nodes in a highly dynamic overlay network. Our evaluation shows that Mercury is able to achieve its goals of logarithmic-hop routing and near-uniform load balancing.We also show that Mercury can be used to solve a key problem for an important class of distributed applications: distributed state maintenance for distributed games. We show that the Mercury-based solution is easy to use, and that it reduces the game's messaging overheard significantly compared to a na\{\i}ve approach.},

In this paper, we show that 802.11 PSM performs poorly due to the fact that an access point is unable to adapt to the requirements of each client. Therefore, we propose a novel power saving algorithm, named Dynamic Beacon Period, where the access point uses different beacon periods for different clients. During HTTP downloads, each client carefully chooses a good beacon period for itself, based on the RTT of its current connections, and informs the access point of this beacon period. This technique enables download times for Web pages that are comparable to those without any power-saving and provides energy savings comparable to the standard 802.11 PSM. We show, using real-world measurements and emulation-based experiments, that it is feasible for both clients and access points to efficiently support such per-client beacon periods, instead of having a common, static beacon for all clients. The solution is simple enough that it can be implemented with just small enhancements to the existing 802.11 specification.},

However, a tree topology is not robust against node and communication failures, which are common in sensor networks. In this paper, we present <i>synopsis diffusion</i>, a general framework for achieving signi.cantly more accurate and reliable answers by combining energy-efficient multi-path routing schemes with techniques that avoid double-counting. Synopsis diffusion avoids double-counting through the use of <i>order- and duplicate-insensitive (ODI) synopses</i> that compactly summarize intermediate results during in-network aggregation. We provide a surprisingly simple test that makes it easy to check the correctness of an ODI synopsis. We show that the properties of ODI synopses and synopsis di.usion create <i>implicit</i> acknowledgments of packet delivery. We show that this property can, in turn, enable the system to adapt message routing to dynamic message loss conditions, even in the presence of asymmetric links. Finally, we illustrate, using extensive simulations, the significant robustness, accuracy, and energy-efficiency improvements of synopsis diffusion over previous approaches.},

Although a few studies have been devoted to characterizing its properties, such as its workload and the stability of the top-level servers, many key components of DNS have not yet been examined. Based on large-scale measurements taken fromservers in a large content distribution network, we present a detailed study of key characteristics of the DNS infrastructure, such as load distribution, availability, and deployment patterns of DNS servers. Our analysis includes both local DNS servers and servers in the authoritative hierarchy. We find that (1) the vast majority of users use a small fraction of deployed name servers, (2) the availability of most name servers is high, and (3) there exists a larger degree of diversity in local DNS server deployment and usage than for authoritative servers. Furthermore, we use our DNS measurements to draw conclusions about federated infrastructures in general. We evaluate and discuss the impact of federated deployment models on future systems, such as Distributed Hash Tables.},

abstract = {For the last few years, large Web content providers interested in improving their scalability and availability have increasingly turned to three techniques: mirroring, content distribution, and ISP multihoming. The Domain Name System (DNS) has gained a prominent role in the way each of these techniques directs client requests to achieve the goals of scalability and availability. The DNS is thought to offer the transparent and agile control necessary to react quickly to ISP link failures or phenomenon such as flash crowds.In this paper, we investigate this assumption with the objective of quantifying the degree of responsiveness that can be expected from DNS. We use a combination of Web and DNS access measurements from several busy Web sites, as well as a large content distribution network, to characterize the behavior of end-systems and local DNS servers in terms of their adherence to DNS-based controls. Our results suggest that DNS is at best a coarse-grained mechanism, and poorly suited for applications, such as route control, which require quick response to link failures or performance degradations. We then propose several proactive techniques that, when deployed in cooperation between large content providers and important clients, have the potential to improve the responsiveness of DNS-based control.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, wireless networking technologies have made vast forays into our daily lives. Today, one can find 802.11 hardware and other personal wireless technology employed at homes, shopping malls, coffee shops and airports. Present-day wireless network deployments bear two important properties: they are unplanned, with most access points (APs) deployed by users in a spontaneous manner, resulting in highly variable AP densities; and they are unmanaged, since manually configuring and managing a wireless network is very complicated. We refer to such wireless deployments as being chaotic.In this paper, we present a study of the impact of interference in chaotic 802.11 deployments on end-client performance. First, using large-scale measurement data from several cities, we show that it is not uncommon to have tens of APs deployed in close proximity of each other. Moreover, most APs are not configured to minimize interference with their neighbors. We then perform trace-driven simulations to show that the performance of end-clients could suffer significantly in chaotic deployments. We argue that end-client experience could be significantly improved by making chaotic wireless networks self-managing. We design and evaluate automated power control and rate adaptation algorithms to minimize interference among neighboring APs, while ensuring robust end-client performance.},

Although this work is potentially revolutionary in the sense that it holds out the possibility of radically altering the relationship between computation, humans, and the physical world, many of the research questions involved are similar in flavor to more mainstream systems research, albeit larger in scale. For instance, as in sensor networks, each robot will incorporate sensing, computation, and communications components. However, unlike most sensor networks each robot will also include mechanisms for actuation and motion. Many of the key challenges in this project involve coordination and communication of sensing and actuation across such large ensembles of independent units.},

abstract = {Most current sensor network research explores the use of extremely simple sensors on small devices called motes and focuses on over-coming the resource constraints of these devices. In contrast, our research explores the challenges of multimedia sensors and is motivated by the fact that multimedia devices, such as cameras, are rapidly becoming inexpensive, yet their use in a sensor network presents a number of unique challenges. For example, the data rates involved with multimedia sensors are orders of magnitude greater than those for sensor motes and this data cannot easily be processed by traditional sensor network techniques that focus on scalar data. In addition, the richness of the data generated by multimedia sensors makes them useful for a wide variety of applications. This paper presents an overview of IRISNET, a sensor network architecture that enables the creation of a planetary-scale infrastructure of multimedia sensors that can be shared by a large number of applications. To ensure the efficient collection of sensor readings, IRISNET enables the application-specific processing of sensor feeds on the significant computation resources that are typically attached to multimedia sensors. IRISNET enables the storage of sensor readings close to their source by providing a convenient and extensible distributed XML database infrastructure. Finally, IRISNET provides a number of multimedia processing primitives that enable the effective processing of sensor feeds in-network and at-sensor.},

Given a hierarchical database, IDP automatically partitions it among a set of networked hosts, and replicates portions of it. IDP makes decisions based on measurements of access locality within the database, read and write load for individual objects within the database, proximity between queriers and potential replicas, and total load on hosts participating in the database. Our evaluation of IDP under real and synthetic workloads, including flash crowds of queriers, demonstrates that in comparison with previously-studied replica placement techniques, IDP reduces average response times for user queries by up to a factor of 3 and reduces network traffic for queries, updates, and data movements by up to an order of magnitude.},

Several key architectural issues for cognitive radio networks are discussed, including control and management protocols, support for collaborative PHY, dynamic spectrum coordination, flexible MAC layer protocols, ad hoc group formation and cross-layer adaptation. The overall goal of this work is the design and validation of the control/management and data interfaces between cognitive radio nodes in a local network, and also between cognitive radio networks and the global Internet. Protocol design and implementation based on this framework will result in the CogNet architecture, a prototype open-source cognitive radio protocol stack. Experimental evaluations on emerging cognitive radio platforms are planned for future work, first in a wireless local-area radio network scenario using wireless testbeds such as ORBIT, and later as part of several end-to-end experiments using a wide-area network testbed such as PlanetLab (and GENI in the future).},

Our experiments show that commodity 802.11 equipment is surprisingly vulnerable to certain patterns of weak or narrow-band interference. This enables us to disrupt a link with an interfering signal whose power is 1000 times weaker than the victim's 802.11 signals, or to shut down a multiple AP, multiple channel managed network at a location with a single radio interferer. We identify several factors that lead to these vulnerabilities, ranging from MAC layer driver implementation strategies to PHY layer radio frequency implementation strategies. Our results further show that these factors are not overcome by simply changing 802.11 operational parameters (such as CCA threshold, rate and packet size) with the exception of frequency shifts. This leads us to explore rapid channel hopping as a strategy to withstand RF interference. We prototype a channel hopping design using PRISM NICs, and find that it can sustain throughput at levels of RF interference well above that needed to disrupt unmodified links, and at a reasonable cost in terms of switching overheads.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of 802.11 devices and networks enables anyone to track our every move with alarming ease. Each 802.11 device transmits a globally unique and persistent MAC address and thus is trivially identifiable. In response, recent research has proposed replacing such identifiers with pseudonyms (i.e., temporary, unlinkable names). In this paper, we demonstrate that pseudonyms are insufficient to prevent tracking of 802.11 devices because implicit identifiers, or identifying characteristics of 802.11 traffic, can identify many users with high accuracy. For example, even without unique names and addresses, we estimate that an adversary can identify 64\% of users with 90\% accuracy when they spend a day at a busy hot spot. We present an automated procedure based on four previously unrecognized implicit identifiers that can identify users in three real 802.11 traces even when pseudonyms and encryption are employed. We find that the majority of users can be identified using our techniques, but our ability to identify users is not uniform; some users are not easily identifiable. Nonetheless, we show that even a single implicit identifier is sufficient to distinguish many users. Therefore, we argue that design considerations beyond eliminating explicit identifiers (i.e., unique names and addresses), must be addressed in order to prevent user tracking in wireless networks.},

abstract = {Multihoming is increasingly being employed by large enterprises and data centers to extract good performance and reliability from their ISP connections. Multihomed end networks today can employ a variety of route control products to optimize their Internet access performance and reliability. However, little is known about the tangible benefits that such products can offer, the mechanisms they employ and their trade-offs. This paper makes two important contributions. First, we present a study of the potential improvements in Internet round-trip times (RTTs) and transfer speeds from employing multihoming route control. Our analysis shows that multihoming to three or more ISPs and cleverly scheduling traffic across the ISPs can improve Internet RTTs and throughputs by up to 25\% and 20\%, respectively. However, a careful selection of ISPs is important to realize the performance improvements. Second, focusing on large enterprises, we propose and evaluate a wide-range of route control mechanisms and evaluate their design trade-offs. We implement the proposed schemes on a Linux-based Web proxy and perform a trace-based evaluation of their performance. We show that both passive and active measurement-based techniques are equally effective and could improve the Web response times of enterprise networks by up to 25\% on average, compared to using a single ISP. We also outline several "best common practices" for the design of route control products.},

abstract = {Many past systems have explored how to eliminate redundant transfers from network links and improve network efficiency. Several of these systems operate at the application layer, while the more recent systems operate on individual packets. A common aspect of these systems is that they apply to localized settings, e.g. at stub network access links. In this paper, we explore the benefits of deploying packet-level redundant content elimination as a universal primitive on all Internet routers. Such a universal deployment would immediately reduce link loads everywhere. However, we argue that far more significant network-wide benefits can be derived by redesigning network routing protocols to leverage the universal deployment. We develop "redundancy-aware" intra- and inter-domain routing algorithms and show that they enable better traffic engineering, reduce link usage costs, and enhance ISPs' responsiveness to traffic variations. In particular, employing redundancy elimination approaches across redundancy-aware routes can lower intra and inter-domain link loads by 10-50\%. We also address key challenges that may hinder implementation of redundancy elimination on fast routers. Our current software router implementation can run at OC48 speeds.},

abstract = {Without well-provisioned dedicated servers, modern fast-paced action games limit the number of players who can interact simultaneously to 16-32. This is because interacting players must frequently exchange state updates, and high player counts would exceed the bandwidth available to participating machines. In this paper, we describe Donnybrook, a system that enables epic-scale battles without dedicated server resources, even in a fast-paced game with tight latency bounds. It achieves this scalability through two novel components. First, it reduces bandwidth demand by estimating what players are paying attention to, thereby enabling it to reduce the frequency of sending less important state updates. Second, it overcomes resource and interest heterogeneity by disseminating updates via a multicast system designed for the special requirements of games: that they have multiple sources, are latency-sensitive, and have frequent group membership changes. We present user study results using a prototype implementation based on Quake III that show our approach provides a desirable user experience. We also present simulation results that demonstrate Donnybrook's efficacy in enabling battles of up to 900 players.},

By obscuring these fields, we greatly increase the difficulty of identifying or profiling users from their transmissions in ways that are otherwise straightforward. Our design, called SlyFi, is nearly as efficient as existing schemes such as WPA for discovery, link setup, and data delivery despite its heightened protections; transmission requires only symmetric key encryption and reception requires a table lookup followed by symmetric key decryption. Experiments using our implementation on Atheros 802.11 drivers show that SlyFi can discover and associate with networks faster than 802.11 using WPA-PSK. The overhead SlyFi introduces in packet delivery is only slightly higher than that added by WPA-CCMP encryption (10\% vs. 3\% decrease in throughput).},

We demonstrate that the two pass method dramatically reduces the time spent in active measurement while retaining accuracy.

This limitation makes various applications, such as remote backup and sharing high definition video, impractical. However, homes in a neighborhood often have high bandwidth wireless networks, whose bandwidth exceeds that of a single wired uplink. Moreover, most (wired and wireless) connections are idle most of the time.In this paper, we examine the fundamental requirements of a system that aggregates upstream broadband connections in a neighborhood using wireless communication between homes. A scheme addressing this problem must operate efficiently in an environment that is: i) highly lossy; ii) broadcast in nature; and iii) half-duplex. We propose a novel scheme, Link-alike, that addresses those three challenges using opportunistic wireless reception, a novel wireless broadcast rate control scheme, and preferential use of the wired downlink. Through analytical and experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach provides significantly better throughput than previous solutions based on TCP or UDP unicast.},

However, a tree topology is not robust against node and communication failures, which are common in sensor networks. In this article, we present synopsis diffusion, a general framework for achieving significantly more accurate and reliable answers by combining energy-efficient multipath routing schemes with techniques that avoid double-counting. Synopsis diffusion avoids double-counting through the use of order- and duplicate-insensitive (ODI) synopses that compactly summarize intermediate results during in-network aggregation. We provide a surprisingly simple test that makes it easy to check the correctness of an ODI synopsis. We show that the properties of ODI synopses and synopsis diffusion create implicit acknowledgments of packet delivery. Such acknowledgments enable energy-efficient adaptation of message routes to dynamic message loss conditions, even in the presence of asymmetric links. Finally, we illustrate using extensive simulations the significant robustness, accuracy, and energy-efficiency improvements of synopsis diffusion over previous approaches.},

abstract="Many previous studies have examined the placement of access points (APs) to improve the community's understanding of the deployment and behavioral characteristics of wireless networks. A key implicit assumption in these studies is that one can estimate the AP location accurately from wardriving-like measurements. However, existing localization algorithms exhibit high error because they over-simplify the complex nature of signal propagation. In this work, we propose a novel approach that localizes APs using directional information derived from local signal strength variations. Our algorithm only uses signal strength information, and improves localization accuracy over existing techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm is robust to the sampling biases and non-uniform shadowing, which are common in wardriving measurements.",

abstract = {Networking researchers have been using tools like wireshark and tcpdump to sniff packets on physical links that use different types of datalink protocols, e.g. Ethernet or 802.11, allowing them to monitor higher level protocols sharing these links. However, monitoring wireless links is more challenging, since the transmission medium is shared by flows using diverse datalink protocols (e.g. 802.11, Bluetooth) and physical layer schemes (e.g. QPSK and GFSK). To this end, we propose RFDump, a software architecture for monitoring packets on heterogeneous wireless networks. The key idea underlying our architecture is the use of a fast detection stage which can tentatively map signals to protocols very efficiently. As a result, RFDump can scale up to a modest number (5-10) of wireless technologies.We implemented RFDump on the GNU Radio and USRP platforms. This is, to our knowledge, the first inexpensive software-based infrastructure for simultaneously analyzing multiple wireless protocols in real-time. Using traces from the real world and from a wireless emulator testbed, we show that our implementation is efficient and accurate. Further, we demonstrate that our system is extensible and scales with the addition of new protocols.},

abstract = {The demand for wireless bandwidth in indoor environments such as homes and offices continues to increase rapidly. Although wireless technologies such as MIMO can reach link throughputs of 100s of Mbps (802.11n) for a single link, the question of how we can deliver high throughput to a large number of densely-packed devices remains an open problem. Directional antennas have been shown to be an effective way to increase spatial reuse, but past work has focused largely on outdoor environments where the interactions between wireless links can usually be ignored. This assumption is not acceptable in dense indoor wireless networks since indoor deployments need to deal with rich scattering and multipath effects. In this paper we introduce DIRC, a wireless network design whose access points use phased array antennas to achieve high throughput in dense, indoor environments. The core of DIRC is an algorithm that increases spatial reuse and maximizes overall network capacity by optimizing the orientations of a network of directional antennas. We implemented DIRC and evaluated it on a nine node network in an enterprise setting. Our results show that DIRC improves overall network capacity in indoor environments, while being flexible enough to adapt to node mobility and changing traffic workloads.},

Unfortunately, there is currently no way for users to determine which hotspot access points (APs) will be sufficient to run their applications before purchasing access. To address this problem, this paper presents Wifi-Reports, a collaborative service that provides Wi-Fi clients with historical information about AP performance and application support. The key research challenge in Wifi-Reports is to obtain accurate user-submitted reports. This is challenging because two conflicting goals must be addressed in a practical system: preserving the privacy of users' reports and limiting fraudulent reports. We introduce a practical cryptographic protocol that achieves both goals, and we address the important engineering challenges in building Wifi-Reports. Using a measurement study of commercial APs in Seattle, we show that Wifi-Reports would improve performance over previous AP selection approaches in 30\%-60\% of locations.},

abstract = {Links and content references form the foundation of the way that users interact today. Unfortunately, the links used today (URLs) are fragile since they tightly specify a protocol, host, and filename. Some past efforts have decoupled this binding to a certain degree; e.g., creating links that bind to byte-level data. We argue that these systems do not go far enough. Our key observation is that users really care about the intent of the referenced link and are relatively agnostic to the byte-level representation. Based on this observation, we argue that references should be bound to the underlying information associated with the referenced content. We call such references Information-Bound References (IBR). In this paper, we focus on the challenges of creating IBRs for multimedia data, since these form a dominant fraction of Internet traffic today. We explore the trade-offs of various alternatives for generating and using IBRs. We identify that it is possible to adapt multimedia fingerprinting algorithms in the literature to generate IBRs.},

abstract = {Multimedia content is a dominant fraction of Internet usage today. At the same time, there is significant heterogeneity in video presentation modes and operating conditions of Internet-enabled devices that access such content. Users are often interested in the content, rather than the specific sources or the formats. The host-centric format of the current Internet does not support these requirements naturally. Neither do the recent data-centric naming proposals, since they rely on naming content based on raw byte-level hashing schemes. We argue that to meet these requirements, enabling content retrieval mechanisms to name and query directly for the underlying information is a good way forward. In addition to decoupling content from available sources and transfer protocols, these "information-aware names" or InfoNames explicitly decouple the information from content presentation factors as well. We envision an InfoName Resolution System (IRS) to resolve location based on InfoNames, while taking into account the operating conditions of devices. In this demo, we present an application to show how InfoNames can serve as presentation-invariant and portable names to fetch video content independent of device capabilities and resource constraints.},

abstract = {Recent work demonstrates that directional antennas have significant potential to improve wireless network capacity in indoor environments. This paper provides a broader exploration of the design space of indoor directional antenna systems along two main dimensions: antenna configuration and antenna control. Studying a number of alternative configurations, we find that directionality on APs and clients can significantly improve performance, even over other configurations with stronger directionality. Moreover, it is sufficient to have a small number of narrow beam antennas to achieve such gains, thus making such a solution practical for actual deployment. Designing systems with directional APs and clients for increased spatial reuse comes, however, with a number of challenges in the way the directional antennas are controlled. Antenna control needs to encompass antenna orientation algorithms, an appropriate MAC layer protocol, and novel client-AP association solutions. To overcome these challenges, we propose Speed, a distributed directional antenna control system that is easy to deploy and significantly improves network capacity over existing solutions.},

However, much like the host-centric IP design, elevating one principal type above others hinders communication between other principals and inhibits the network's capability to evolve. Our work presents the eXpressive Internet Architecture (XIA), an architecture with native support for multiple principals and the ability to evolve its functionality to accommodate new, as yet unforeseen, principals over time. XIA also provides intrinsic security: communicating entities validate that their underlying intent was satisfied correctly without relying on external databases or configuration.In this paper, we focus on core architectural issues in the XIA data plane. We outline key design requirements relating to native support for multiple principals and intrinsic security. We then use case studies to demonstrate how the XIA design facilitates evolvability and flexibility.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that high-power cross-technology interference is becoming a major problem in today's 802.11 networks. Devices like baby monitors and cordless phones can cause a wireless LAN to lose connectivity. The existing approach for dealing with such high-power interferers makes the 802.11 network switch to a different channel; yet the ISM band is becoming increasingly crowded with diverse technologies, and hence many 802.11 access points may not find an interference-free channel.This paper presents TIMO, a MIMO design that enables 802.11n to communicate in the presence of high-power cross-technology interference. Unlike existing MIMO designs, however, which require all concurrent transmissions to belong to the same technology, TIMO can exploit MIMO capabilities to decode in the presence of a signal from a different technology, hence enabling diverse technologies to share the same frequency band. We implement a prototype of TIMO in GNURadio-USRP2 and show that it enables 802.11n to communicate in the presence of interference from baby monitors, cordless phones, and microwave ovens, transforming scenarios with a complete loss of connectivity to operational networks.},

A key network primitive that enables continuous connectivity in cellular networks is handoff. Although handoffs are necessary for mobile devices to maintain connectivity, they can also cause short-term disruptions in application performance. Thus, applications could benefit from the ability to predict impending handoffs with reasonable accuracy, and modify their behavior to counter the performance degradation that accompanies handoffs. In this paper, we study whether attributes relating to the cellular network conditions measured at handsets can accurately predict handoffs. In particular, we develop a machine learning framework to predict handoffs in the near future. An evaluation on handoff traces from a large US cellular carrier shows that our approach can achieve 80\% accuracy -- 27\% better than a naive predictor.},

Understanding how the medium is utilized and inferring the cause of interference, based on observations from a single wireless node, is hard. Past work has used monitoring infrastructures to detect interference between 802.11 nodes in enterprise networks. In this paper, we try to answer the question: "how can we enable users to reason about wireless performance variations without requiring elaborate instrumentation and infrastructure support?". We propose WiMed, a tool that uses only local measurements from commodity 802.11 NICs (at the node being diagnosed) to construct a time map of how the medium is utilized. We have implemented a WiMed prototype using the MadWifi driver for Atheros NICs. Early results show that WiMed is useful and can characterize non-802.11 interference better than existing systems.},

abstract = {Directional antenna systems can provide two benefits 1) improve signal strength and increase communication range, and 2) improve spatial reuse. Recent work has drawn contradicting conclusions in terms of which of the two benefits dominates in indoor environments. These contradicting conclusions are in fact caused by different levels of contention within the environments used in these studies, i.e., noise-dominated vs. interference-dominated.In this paper, we first show that due to emerging applications and technologies, wireless networks are becoming interference-dominated, and thus the ability of the directional antennas to improve spatial reuse is becoming critical. Evaluating the benefits of spatial reuse, however, is difficult especially in indoor environments where multipath have both good and bad effect on spatial reuse.In this paper, we use the separation metric to estimate the effectiveness of directional transmission and guide the placement of directional APs in any particular environment. The separation metric summarizes both the angular and the distance separation for a collection of transmissions in a particular environment. We show that this metric, though simple, is powerful enough to capture the various properties of the deployment and the potential interactions among the directional transmissions. Our experimental results show in several scenarios that the separation metric works well in practice.},

Aggregating multiple backhaul links using 802.11 Access Points has been considered as a solution to increasing the backhaul capacity limit. In this paper, we revisit the problem of backhaul aggregation in the context of interactive applications. We present the IdleChat architecture that uses wireless connectivity to aggregate idle broadband connectivity in a neighborhood to overcome the limits of individual asymmetric broadband uplinks. In contrast to prior work, IdleChat aggregates in a traffic-aware manner, focussing specifically on low-latency, real-time link aggregation in support of interactive applications such as video chat. IdleChat schedules packets in a deadline-aware manner to improve interactivity. We evaluate IdleChat both in an experimental testbed in our lab and in a residential deployment. Our results show that use of IdleChat in existing deployments can improve video SNR by up to a factor of 10 db in the presence of a single neighboring AP. This results in video quality improvement from a MOS score of bad to excellent.},

However, converting these observations into a quantitative quality-of-experience metric turns out to be challenging since these metrics are interrelated in complex and sometimes counter-intuitive ways, and their relationship to user experience can be unpredictable. To further complicate things, many confounding factors are introduced by the nature of the content itself (e.g., user interest, genre). We believe that the issue of interdependency can be addressed by casting this as a machine learning problem to build a suitable predictive model from empirical observations. We also show that setting up the problem based on domain-specific and measurement-driven insights can minimize the impact of the various confounding factors to improve the prediction performance.},

abstract = {Consumers all over the world are increasingly using their smartphones on the go and expect consistent, high quality connectivity at all times. A key network primitive that enables continuous connectivity in cellular networks is handoff. Although handoffs are necessary for mobile devices to maintain connectivity, they can also cause short-term disruptions in application performance. Thus, applications could benefit from the ability to predict impending handoffs with reasonable accuracy, and modify their behavior to counter the performance degradation that accompanies handoffs. In this paper, we study whether attributes relating to the cellular network conditions measured at handsets can accurately predict handoffs. In particular, we develop a machine learning framework to predict handoffs in the near future. An evaluation on handoff traces from a large US cellular carrier shows that our approach can achieve 80\% accuracy - 27\% better than a naive predictor.},

In this paper, we explore the opportunities for addressing this emerging conflict by enabling more intelligent ad delivery to such mobile devices. One especially promising path is leveraging the increasing availability of heterogeneous wireless access technologies (e.g., WiFi, femtocells) that offer less restrictive and more energy-efficient transport substrates for such data traffic. To understand the possibilities that exist, we first profile the advertisement traffic characteristics for some of the most popular advertisement-supported consumer applications, and then analyze the key features of mobile advertisement delivery. We then outline the principles of CAMEO, a middleware that uses predictive profiling of a user's {device, network and usage} context to anticipate the advertisements that need to be served, and then modulates their delivery mechanism to enable effective mobile advertising, but at considerably lower costs.},

By also revealing a strong temporal dependency effect, the studies motivate the need for algorithms to accurately predict RF signal strength distributions in dynamic indoor environments.

As an initial case study, we examine network congestion in bufferless NoCs. We show that congestion manifests itself differently in a NoC than in traditional networks. Network congestion reduces system throughput in congested workloads for smaller NoCs (16 and 64 nodes), and limits the scalability of larger bufferless NoCs (256 to 4096 nodes) even when traffic has locality (e.g., when an application's required data is mapped nearby to its core in the network). We propose a new source throttling-based congestion control mechanism with application-level awareness that reduces network congestion to improve system performance. Our mechanism improves system performance by up to 28\% (15\% on average in congested workloads) in smaller NoCs, achieves linear throughput scaling in NoCs up to 4096 cores (attaining similar performance scalability to a NoC with large buffers), and reduces power consumption by up to 20\%. Thus, we show an effective application of a network-level concept, congestion control, to a class of networks -- bufferless on-chip networks -- that has not been studied before by the networking community.},

While other versions of the same content better suited to their device and network constraints may be available on other third-party hosting sites, these remain unusable because users cannot efficiently discover these and verify that these variants match the content publisher's original intent. Our vision is to enable consumers to leverage verifiable alternatives from different hosting sites that are best suited to their constraints to deliver a high quality of experience and enable content publishers to reach a wide audience with diverse operating conditions with minimal upfront costs.

To meet these growing demands, the CDN infrastructure must be designed, provisioned and managed appropriately. Federated telco-CDNs and hybrid P2P-CDNs are two content delivery infrastructure designs that have gained significant industry attention recently. We observed several user access patterns that have important implications to these two designs in our unique dataset consisting of 30 million video sessions spanning around two months of video viewership from two large Internet video providers. These include partial interest in content, regional interests, temporal shift in peak load and patterns in evolution of interest. We analyze the impact of our findings on these two designs by performing a large scale measurement study. Surprisingly, we find significant amount of synchronous viewing behavior for Video On Demand (VOD) content, which makes hybrid P2P-CDN approach feasible for VOD and suggest new strategies for CDNs to reduce their infrastructure costs. We also find that federation can significantly reduce telco-CDN provisioning costs by as much as 95\%.},

abstract = {Improving users' quality of experience (QoE) is crucial for sustaining the advertisement and subscription based revenue models that enable the growth of Internet video. Despite the rich literature on video and QoE measurement, our understanding of Internet video QoE is limited because of the shift from traditional methods of measuring video quality (e.g., Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and user experience (e.g., opinion scores). These have been replaced by new quality metrics (e.g., rate of buffering, bitrate) and new engagement centric measures of user experience (e.g., viewing time and number of visits). The goal of this paper is to develop a predictive model of Internet video QoE. To this end, we identify two key requirements for the QoE model: (1) it has to be tied in to observable user engagement and (2) it should be actionable to guide practical system design decisions. Achieving this goal is challenging because the quality metrics are interdependent, they have complex and counter-intuitive relationships to engagement measures, and there are many external factors that confound the relationship between quality and engagement (e.g., type of video, user connectivity). To address these challenges, we present a data-driven approach to model the metric interdependencies and their complex relationships to engagement, and propose a systematic framework to identify and account for the confounding factors. We show that a delivery infrastructure that uses our proposed model to choose CDN and bitrates can achieve more than 20\% improvement in overall user engagement compared to strawman approaches.},

As a result, TCP has evolved over time with new congestion control algorithms such as support for generalized AIMD, background flows, and multipath. On the other hand, explicit congestion control algorithms have been shown to be more efficient. However, they are inherently more rigid because they rely on in-network components. Therefore, it is not clear whether they can be made flexible enough to support diverse application requirements. This paper presents a flexible framework for network resource allocation, called FCP, that accommodates diversity by exposing a simple abstraction for resource allocation. FCP incorporates novel primitives for end-point flexibility (aggregation and preloading) into a single framework and makes economics-based congestion control practical by explicitly handling load variations and by decoupling it from actual billing. We show that FCP allows evolution by accommodating diversity and ensuring coexistence, while being as efficient as existing explicit congestion control algorithms.},

However, the current economic models and mechanisms for mobile advertising are fundamentally not sustainable and far from ideal. In particular, as we show, applications which use mobile advertising are capable of using significant amounts of a mobile users' critical resources without being controlled or held accountable. This paper seeks to redress this situation by enabling advertisement supported applications to become significantly more ``user-friendly''. To this end, we present the design and implementation of CAMEO, a new framework for mobile advertising that 1) employs intelligent and proactive retrieval of advertisements, using context prediction, to significantly reduce the bandwidth and energy overheads of advertising, and 2) provides a negotiation protocol and framework that empowers applications to subsidize their data traffic costs by ``bartering'' their advertisement rights for access bandwidth from mobile ISPs. Our evaluation, that uses real mobile advertising data collected from around the globe, demonstrates that CAMEO effectively reduces the resource consumption caused by mobile advertising.},

abstract = {Despite the plethora of incremental deployment mechanisms proposed, rapid adoption of new network-layer protocols and architectures remains difficult as reflected by the widespread lack of IPv6 traffic on the Internet. We show that all deployment mechanisms must address four key questions: How to select an egress from the source network, how to select an ingress into the destination network, how to reach that egress, and how to reach that ingress. By creating a design space that maps all existing mechanisms by how they answer these questions, we identify the lack of existing mechanisms in part of this design space and propose two novel approaches: the "4ID" and the "Smart 4ID". The 4ID mechanism utilizes new data plane technology to flexibly decide when to encapsulate packets at forwarding time. The Smart 4ID mechanism additionally adopts an SDN-style control plane to intelligently pick ingress/egress pairs based on a wider view of the local network. We implement these mechanisms along with two widely used IPv6 deployment mechanisms and conduct wide-area deployment experiments over PlanetLab. We conclude that Smart 4ID provide better overall performance and failure semantics, and that innovations in the data plane and control plane enable straightforward incremental deployment.},

abstract="An increasing number of mobile devices are capable of automatically sensing and recording rich information about the surrounding environment. Spatial locations of such data can help to better learn about the environment. In this work, we address the problem of identifying the locations visited by a mobile device as it moves within an indoor environment. We focus on devices equipped with odometry sensors that capture changes in motion. Odometry suffers from cumulative errors of dead reckoning but it captures the relative shape of the traversed path well. Our approach will correct such errors by matching the shape of the trajectory from odometry to traversable paths of a known map. Our algorithm is inspired by prior vehicular GPS map matching techniques that snap global GPS measurements to known roads. We similarly wish to snap the trajectory from odometry to known hallways. Several modifications are required to ensure these techniques are robust when given relative measurements from odometry. If we assume an office-like environment with only straight hallways, then a significant rotation indicates a transition to another hallway. As a result, we partition the trajectory into line segments based on significant turns. Each trajectory segment is snapped to a corresponding hallway that best maintains the shape of the original trajectory. These snapping decisions are made based on the similarity of the two curves as well as the rotation to transition between hallways. We will show robustness under different types of noise in complex environments and the ability to propose coarse sensor noise errors.",

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that web browsing is one of the most prominent cellular applications. It is therefore important for cellular network operators to understand how radio network characteristics (such as signal strength, handovers, load, etc.) influence users' web browsing Quality-of-Experience (web QoE). Understanding the relationship between web QoE and network characteristics is a pre-requisite for cellular network operators to detect when and where degraded network conditions actually impact web QoE. Unfortunately, cellular network operators do not have access to detailed server-side or client-side logs to directly measure web QoE metrics, such as abandonment rate and session length. In this paper, we first devise a machine-learning-based mechanism to infer web QoE metrics from network traces accurately. We then present a large-scale study characterizing the impact of network characteristics on web QoE using a month-long anonymized dataset collected from a major cellular network provider. Our results show that improving signal-to-noise ratio, decreasing load and reducing handovers can improve user experience. We find that web QoE is very sensitive to inter-radio-access-technology (IRAT) handovers. We further find that higher radio data link rate does not necessarily lead to better web QoE. Since many network characteristics are interrelated, we also use machine learning to accurately model the influence of radio network characteristics on user experience metrics. This model can be used by cellular network operators to prioritize the improvement of network factors that most influence web QoE.},

abstract = {The wide spread use of smart phones has ushered in a wave of context-based advertising services that operate on pre-defined user events. A prime example is Location Based Advertising. What is missing though, is the ability to experiment with these services under varying event conditions with real users using their regular phones in real-world environments. Such experiments provide greater insight into user needs for and responsiveness towards context-based advertising applications. However, these event-driven experiments rely on data that arrive from sources such as mobile sensors which have inherent uncertainties associated with them. This effects the interpretation of the outcome of an experiment. In this paper we introduce Jarvis, a behavioural experimentation platform that supports running in-situ real-time experiments of mobile advertising services, targeting real participants on their smart phones based on multiple context-specific events. We highlight the challenges of handling uncertainty on such a platform as well as how we deal with ambiguity in the location attribute.},

Our design overcomes challenges inherent to monitoring with the phone (e.g., it is location agnostic without in-door localization) to derive where signals go and what they interfere with.

abstract = {A range of new datacenter switch designs combine wireless or optical circuit technologies with electrical packet switching to deliver higher performance at lower cost than traditional packet-switched networks. These "hybrid" networks schedule large traffic demands via a high-rate circuits and remaining traffic with a lower-rate, traditional packet-switches. Achieving high utilization requires an efficient scheduling algorithm that can compute proper circuit configurations and balance traffic across the switches. Recent proposals, however, provide no such algorithm and rely on an omniscient oracle to compute optimal switch configurations.Finding the right balance of circuit and packet switch use is difficult: circuits must be reconfigured to serve different demands, incurring non-trivial switching delay, while the packet switch is bandwidth constrained. Adapting existing crossbar scheduling algorithms proves challenging with these constraints. In this paper, we formalize the hybrid switching problem, explore the design space of scheduling algorithms, and provide insight on using such algorithms in practice. We propose a heuristic-based algorithm, Solstice that provides a 2.9\texttimes{} increase in circuit utilization over traditional scheduling algorithms, while being within 14\% of optimal, at scale.},

abstract = {Live video delivery is expected to reach a peak of 50 Tbps this year. This surging popularity is fundamentally changing the Internet video delivery landscape. CDNs must meet users' demands for fast join times, high bitrates, and low buffering ratios, while minimizing their own cost of delivery and responding to issues in real-time. Wide-area latency, loss, and failures, as well as varied workloads ("mega-events" to long-tail), make meeting these demands challenging.An analysis of video sessions concluded that a centralized controller could improve user experience, but CDN systems have shied away from such designs due to the difficulty of quickly handling failures, a requirement of both operators and users. We introduce VDN, a practical approach to a video delivery network that uses a centralized algorithm for live video optimization. VDN provides CDN operators with real-time, fine-grained control. It does this in spite of challenges resulting from the wide-area (e.g., state inconsistency, partitions, failures) by using a hybrid centralized+distributed control plane, increasing average bitrate by 1.7x and decreasing cost by 2x in different scenarios.},

abstract = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has quickly moved from the realm of hype to reality with estimates of over 25 billion devices deployed by 2020. While IoT has huge potential for societal impact, it comes with a number of key security challenges---IoT devices can become the entry points into critical infrastructures and can be exploited to leak sensitive information. Traditional host-centric security solutions in today's IT ecosystems (e.g., antivirus, software patches) are fundamentally at odds with the realities of IoT (e.g., poor vendor security practices and constrained hardware). We argue that the network will have to play a critical role in securing IoT deployments. However, the scale, diversity, cyberphysical coupling, and cross-device use cases inherent to IoT require us to rethink network security along three key dimensions: (1) abstractions for security policies; (2) mechanisms to learn attack and normal profiles; and (3) dynamic and context-aware enforcement capabilities. Our goal in this paper is to highlight these challenges and sketch a roadmap to avoid this impending security disaster.},

While other versions of the same content better suited to their device and network constraints may be available on other third-party hosting sites, these remain unusable because users cannot efficiently discover these and verify that these variants match the content publisher's original intent. Our vision is to enable consumers to leverage verifiable alternatives from different hosting sites that are best suited to their constraints to deliver a high quality of experience and enable content publishers to reach a wide audience with diverse operating conditions with minimal upfront costs. To this end, we make a case for information-bound references or IBRs that bind references to video content to the underlying information that a publisher wants to convey, decoupled from details such as protocols, hosts, file names, or the underlying bits. This paper addresses key challenges in the design and implementation of IBR generation and resolution mechanisms, and presents an evaluation of the benefits IBRs offer.},

In order to meet the scale and quality demands imposed by users, content providers have started to spread demand across a variety of CDNs using a broker. Brokers break many traditional CDN assumptions (e.g., unexpected traffic skew, significant variance in demand over short timescales, etc.).

Fundamentally, practical implementations require estimating upcoming traffic demand. Unfortunately, as our results show, it is difficult to accurately predict demand in typical datacenter applications more than a few milliseconds ahead of time. We explore the impact of errors in demand estimation on traffic scheduling in circuit-switched networks. We show that even relatively small estimation errors such as shifting the arrival time of at most 30\% of traffic by a few milliseconds can lead to suboptimal schedules that dramatically reduce network efficiency. Existing systems cope by provisioning extra capacity---either on each circuit, or through the addition of a separate packet-switched fabric. We show through simulation that indirect traffic routing is a powerful technique for recovering from the inefficiencies of suboptimal scheduling under common datacenter workloads, performing as well as networks with 16\% extra circuit bandwidth or a packet switch with 6\% of the circuit bandwidth.},

More fundamentally though, content providers are shifting delivery from a single CDN to multiple CDNs, through the use of a content broker. Brokers have been shown to invalidate many traditional delivery assumptions (e.g., shifting traffic invalidates short- and long-term traffic prediction) by not communicating their decisions with CDNs. In this work, we analyze these problems using data from a CDN and a broker. We examine the design space of potential solutions, finding that a marketplace design (inspired by advertising exchanges) potentially provides interesting tradeoffs. A marketplace allows all CDNs to profit on video delivery through fine-grained pricing and optimization, where CDNs learn risk-adverse bidding strategies to aid in traffic prediction. We implement a marketplace-based system (which we dub Video Delivery eXchange or VDX) in CDN and broker data-driven simulation, finding significant improvements in cost and data-path distance.},

In this paper, we envision that by enabling network switches to access remote memory purely from data planes, the performance of a wide range of applications can be improved. We design three remote memory primitives, leveraging RDMA operations, and show the feasibility of accessing remote memory from switches using our prototype implementation.},

abstract = {Storage systems in data centers are an important component of large-scale online services. They typically perform replicated transactional operations for high data availability and integrity. Today, however, such operations suffer from high tail latency even with recent kernel bypass and storage optimizations, and thus affect the predictability of end-to-end performance of these services. We observe that the root cause of the problem is the involvement of the CPU, a precious commodity in multi-tenant settings, in the critical path of replicated transactions. In this paper, we present HyperLoop, a new framework that removes CPU from the critical path of replicated transactions in storage systems by offloading them to commodity RDMA NICs, with non-volatile memory as the storage medium. To achieve this, we develop new and general NIC offloading primitives that can perform memory operations on all nodes in a replication group while guaranteeing ACID properties without CPU involvement. We demonstrate that popular storage applications can be easily optimized using our primitives. Our evaluation results with microbenchmarks and application benchmarks show that HyperLoop can reduce 99th percentile latency ≈ 800X with close to 0\% CPU consumption on replicas.},

abstract = {Modern content delivery networks (CDNs) allow their customers (i.e., operators of web services) to customize the processing of requests by uploading and executing code at the edges of the CDN's network. To achieve scale, CDNs have forgone heavyweight virtualization techniques. Instead, all requests often execute within the same OS or even process. However, performance interference may arise when these requests have differing demands on multiple system resources. In this paper, we study the sources of performance interference based on workloads from real customers, identify the lack of multi-resource fairness as the culprit, and show that existing schedulers available in commodity OSs are insufficient to enforce fairness between customers.We then design Sandpaper, a new and practical multi-resource request scheduler for mitigating performance interference in CDN edge environments. Sandpaper enforces fairness despite constraints, such as sitting within the application runtime and running atop the OS's underlying resource schedulers. By leveraging key insights about the differences between theoretical system models and real systems, Sandpaper bridges the trade-off between resource utilization and multi-resource fairness that plagues existing schedulers. We implement Sandpaper atop Varnish, an open-source CDN edge proxy, and show that it mitigates performance interference while maintaining high resource utilization and with little performance overhead.},

abstract = {Social live video streaming (SLVS) applications are becoming increasingly popular with the rise of platforms such as Facebook-Live, YouTube-Live, Twitch and Periscope. A key characteristic that differentiates this new class of applications from traditional live streaming is that these live streams are watched by viewers at different delays; while some viewers watch a live stream in real-time, others view the content in a time-shifted manner at different delays. In the presence of variability in the upload bandwidth, which is typical in mobile environments, existing solutions silo viewers into either receiving low latency video at a lower quality or a higher quality video with a significant delay penalty, without accounting for the presence of diverse time-shifted viewers.In this paper, we present Vantage, a live-streaming upload solution that improves the overall quality of experience for diverse time-shifted viewers by using selective quality-enhancing retransmissions in addition to real-time frames, optimizing the encoding schedules to balance the allocation of the available bandwidth between the two. Our evaluation using real-world mobile network traces shows that Vantage can provide high quality simultaneously for both low-latency and delayed viewing.For delayed viewing, Vantage achieves an average improvement of 19.9\% over real-time optimized video streaming techniques across all the network traces and test videos, with observed gains of up to 42.9\%. These benefits come at the cost of an average drop in real-time quality of 3.3\%, with a maximum drop of 7.1\%. This represents a significant performance improvement over current techniques used for SLVS applications, which primarily optimize the video upload for real-time viewing.},

abstract = {BBR is a new congestion control algorithm (CCA) deployed for Chromium QUIC and the Linux kernel. As the default CCA for YouTube (which commands 11+\% of Internet traffic), BBR has rapidly become a major player in Internet congestion control. BBR's fairness or friendliness to other connections has recently come under scrutiny as measurements from multiple research groups have shown undesirable outcomes when BBR competes with traditional CCAs. One such outcome is a fixed, 40\% proportion of link capacity consumed by a single BBR flow when competing with as many as 16 loss-based algorithms like Cubic or Reno. In this short paper, we provide the first model capturing BBR's behavior in competition with loss-based CCAs. Our model is coupled with practical experiments to validate its implications. The key lesson is this: under competition, BBR becomes window-limited by its 'in-flight cap' which then determines BBR's bandwidth consumption. By modeling the value of BBR's in-flight cap under varying network conditions, we can predict BBR's throughput when competing against Cubic flows with a median error of 5\%, and against Reno with a median of 8\%.},

abstract = {Programmable switches have been touted as an attractive alternative for deploying network functions (NFs) such as network address translators (NATs), load balancers, and firewalls. However, their limited memory capacity has been a major stumbling block that has stymied their adoption for supporting state-intensive NFs such as cloud-scale NATs and load balancers that maintain millions of flow-table entries. In this paper, we explore a new approach that leverages DRAM on servers available in typical NFV clusters. Our new system architecture, called TEA (Table Extension Architecture), provides a virtual table abstraction that allows NFs on programmable switches to look up large virtual tables built on external DRAM. Our approach enables switch ASICs to access external DRAM purely in the data plane without involving CPUs on servers. We address key design and implementation challenges in realizing this idea. We demonstrate its feasibility and practicality with our implementation on a Tofino-based programmable switch. Our evaluation shows that NFs built with TEA can look up table entries on external DRAM with low and predictable latency (1.8-2.2 μs) and the lookup throughput can be linearly scaled with additional servers (138 million lookups per seconds with 8 servers).},

abstract = {Renewable energy is becoming an important power source for data centers, especially with the zero-carbon waste pledges made by big cloud providers. However, one of the main challenges of renewable energy sources is the high variability of power produced. Traditional approaches such as batteries or transmitting to the grid fall short on scale, overhead, or "green-ness". We propose Virtual Battery: instead of adapting the availability of power to match the computation demand we shift computational demand to meet the availability of power. Virtual batteries shift demand by requiring applications to either be flexible and delay-tolerant or proactively migrating to where power is (going to be) available. We show that using multiple virtual battery sites in combination can meet the needs of modern applications. Moreover, we show how an intelligent network and power aware co-scheduler can not only provide availability despite variability but also help mitigate migration related network overhead by over 30\% in total and 4.2x at peak.},

In this paper, we design and implement RedPlane, a fault-tolerant state store for stateful in-switch applications. This provides in-switch applications consistent access to their state, even if the switch they run on fails or traffic is rerouted to an alternative switch. We address key challenges in devising a practical, provably correct replication protocol and implementing it in the switch data plane. Our evaluations show that RedPlane incurs negligible overhead and enables end-to-end applications to rapidly recover from switch failures.},

In some domains, theoretical proofs have provided clarity on the conditions where a heuristic is guaranteed to work well. This has not been possible in all domains because proving such guarantees can involve combinatorial reasoning making it hard, cumbersome and error-prone. In this paper we argue that computers should help humans with the combinatorial part of reasoning. We model reasoning questions as ∃∀ formulas [1] and solve them using the counterexample guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) framework. As preliminary evidence, we prototype CCmatic, a tool that semi-automatically synthesizes congestion control algorithms that are provably robust. It rediscovered a recent congestion control algorithm that provably achieves high utilization and bounded delay under a challenging network model. It also found previously unknown variants of the algorithm that achieve different throughput-delay trade-offs.},

However, existing TCP variants are ill-suited to utilize available capacity because their congestion control cannot react quickly enough to drastic variations in bandwidth and latency.We present Time-division TCP (TDTCP), a new TCP variant designed for reconfigurable data center networks. TDTCP recognizes that communication in these fabrics happens over a set of paths, each having its own physical characteristics and cross traffic. TDTCP multiplexes each connection across multiple independent congestion states---one for each distinct path---while managing connection-wide tasks in a shared fashion. It leverages network support to receive timely notification of path changes and promptly matches its local view to the current path. We implement TDTCP in the Linux kernel. Results on an emulated network show that TDTCP improves throughput over both traditional TCP variants, such as DCTCP and CUBIC, and multipath TCP by 24--41\% without requiring significant in-network buffering to hide path variations.},

Compared to more common point cloud based methods, we show that textured mesh data requires less bandwidth and yields the same visual quality. However, textured mesh reconstruction is compute and memory intensive, mesh simplification is not easily parallelizable, and texture maps lacks spatial and temporal coherence. Mosaic tackles these challenges by examining each computational stage and determines how they can be efficiently distributed across multiple compute nodes to reduce overall latency, minimize bandwidth, and maintain quality. We then provide an end-to-end latency and bandwidth breakdown that can be used to target future acceleration work.},

abstract = {Real-time interactive video streaming applications like cloud-based video games, AR, and VR require high quality video streams and extremely low end-to-end interaction delays. These requirements cause the QoE to be extremely sensitive to packet losses. Due to the inter-dependency between compressed frames, packet losses stall the video decode pipeline until the lost packets are retransmitted (resulting in stutters and higher delays), or the decoder state is reset using IDR-frames (lower video quality for given bandwidth). Prism is a hybrid predictive-reactive packet loss recovery scheme that uses a split-stream video coding technique to meet the needs of ultra-low latency video streaming applications. Prism's approach enables aggressive loss prediction, rapid loss recovery, and high video quality post-recovery, with zero overhead during normal operation - avoiding the pitfalls of existing approaches. Our evaluation on real video game footage shows that Prism reduces the penalty of using I-frames for recovery by 81\%, while achieving 30\% lower delay than pure retransmission-based recovery.},

abstract = {Many modern-day XR devices (e.g. mobile headsets, phones, etc.) lack the computing resources required to render complex 3D scenes in real-time. Typically, to render a high-resolution scene on a lightweight XR device, 3D designers arduously decimate and fine-tune the objects. As an alternative, remote rendering systems can utilize powerful nearby servers to stream rendering results to a client. While this is a promising solution, it can introduce a variety of latency and reliability issues, especially under variable network conditions. In this paper, we present a distributed rendering system that combines both remote rendering and on-device, “local” rendering to add robustness to network fluctuations and device workloads. To maximize user QoE, our approach dynamically swaps an object’s rendering medium, adjusting for client workload, low frame rates, and several perceptual characteristics. To model these characteristics, we perform a study under simulated conditions to measure how users perceive latency and complexity differences between objects in a scene. Using the results of the study, we then provide an algorithm for choosing the optimal object rendering medium, based on rendering complexity as well as network and latency models, ensuring that a target frame rate will be met. Finally, we evaluate this algorithm on a prototype implementation that can provide cross-platform split rendering using web technologies.},

abstract = { 3D video enables a remote viewer to observe a 3D scene from any angle or location. However, current 3D capture solutions incur high latency, consume significant bandwidth, and scale poorly with the number of depth sensors and size of scenes. These problems are largely caused by the current monolithic approach to 3D capture and the use of inefficient data representations for streaming. This paper introduces MeshReduce, a distributed scene capture, stream, and render system that advocates for the use of textured mesh data representation early in the 3D video capture and transmission process. Textured meshes are compact and can provide lower bitrates for the same quality compared to other 3D data representations. However, streaming textured meshes creates compute and memory challenges to achieve bandwidth efficiency. MeshReduce addresses these issues by using a pipeline that creates independent mesh reconstructions and incrementally merges them, rather than creating a single mesh directly from all sensor streams. While this enables a more efficient implementation, this approach requires optimal exchange of textured meshes across the network. MeshReduce also incorporates a novel approach for network rate control that divides bandwidth between texture and mesh for efficient, adaptive 3D video streaming. We demonstrate a real-time integrated embedded compute implementation of MeshReduce that can operate with commercial Azure Kinect depth cameras as well as a custom sensor front-end that uses LiDAR and 360° camera inputs to dramatically increase coverage. },

abstract = {We present CCAnalyzer, a novel classifier for deployed Internet congestion control algorithms (CCAs) which is more accurate, more generalizable, and more human-interpretable than prior classifiers. CCAnalyzer requires no knowledge of the underlying CCA algorithms, and it can identify when a CCA is novel - i.e. not in the training set. Furthermore, CCAnalyzer can cluster together servers it believes use the same novel/unknown algorithm. CCAnalyzer correctly identifies all 15 of the default Internet CCAs deployed with Linux, including BBRv1, which no existing classifier can do. Finally, CCAnalyzer can classify server CCAs while being as efficient or better than prior approaches in terms of bytes transferred and runtime. We conduct a measurement study using CCAnalyzer measuring the CCA for 5000+ websites. We find widespread deployment of BBRv1 at large CDNs, and demonstrate how our clustering technique can detect deployments of new algorithms as it discovers BBRv3 although BBRv3 is not in its training set.},

abstract = {With the rise of heterogeneous congestion control algorithms and increasingly complex application control loops (e.g. adaptive bitrate algorithms), the Internet community has expressed growing concern that network bandwidth allocations are unfairly skewed, and that some Internet services are 'winners' at the expense of 'losing' services when competing over shared bottlenecks. In this paper, we provide the first study of fairness between live, end-to-end services with distinct workloads. Rather than focusing on individual components of an application stack (e.g., studying the fairness of an individual congestion control algorithm), we want to provide a direct study over real-world deployed applications. Among our findings, we observe that services typically achieve less-than-fair outcomes: on average, the 'losing' service achieves only 72\% of its max-min fair share of link bandwidth. We also find that some services are significantly more contentious than others: for example, one popular file distribution service causes competing applications to obtain as low as 16\% of their max-min fair share of bandwidth when competing in a moderately-constrained setting.},

abstract = {In datacenters, common incast traffic patterns are challenging because they violate the basic premise of bandwidth stability on which TCP congestion control convergence is built, overwhelming shallow switch buffers and causing packet losses and high latency. To understand why these challenges remain despite decades of research on datacenter congestion control, we conduct an in-depth investigation into high-degree incasts both in production workloads at Meta and in simulation. In addition to characterizing the bursty nature of these incasts and their impacts on the network, our findings demonstrate the shortcomings of widely deployed window-based congestion control techniques used to address incast problems. Furthermore, we find that hosts associated with a specific application or service exhibit similar and predictable incast traffic properties across hours, pointing the way toward solutions that predict and prevent incast bursts, instead of reacting to them.},

abstract = {The emergence of the Spatial Web -- the Web where content is tied to real-world locations has the potential to improve and enable many applications such as augmented reality, navigation, robotics, and more. The Spatial Web is missing a key ingredient that is impeding its growth -- a spatial naming system to resolve real-world locations to names. Today's spatial naming systems are digital maps such as Google and Apple maps. These maps and the location-based services provided on top of these maps are primarily controlled by a few large corporations and mostly cover outdoor public spaces. Emerging classes of applications, such as persistent world-scale augmented reality, require detailed maps of both outdoor and indoor spaces. Existing centralized mapping infrastructures are proving insufficient for such applications because of the scale of cartography efforts required and the privacy of indoor map data.In this paper, we present a case for a federated spatial naming system, or in other words, a federated mapping infrastructure. This enables disparate parties to manage and serve their own maps of physical regions and unlocks scalability of map management, isolation and privacy of maps. Map-related services such as address-to-location mapping, location-based search, and routing needs re-architecting to work on federated maps. We discuss some essential services and practicalities of enabling these services.},

abstract = {World-scale augmented reality (AR) applications need a ubiquitous 6DoF localization backend to anchor content to the real world
consistently across devices. Large organizations such as Google
and Niantic are 3D scanning outdoor public spaces in order to
build their own Visual Positioning Systems (VPS). These centralized VPS solutions fail to meet the needs of many future AR
applications—they do not cover private indoor spaces because of
privacy concerns, regulations, and the labor bottleneck of updating and maintaining 3D scans. In this paper, we present OpenFLAME, a federated VPS backend that allows independent organizations to 3D scan and maintain a separate VPS service for their
own spaces. This enables access control of indoor 3D scans, distributed maintenance of the VPS backend, and encourages larger
coverage. Sharding of VPS services introduces several unique
challenges—coherency of localization results across spaces, quality control of VPS services, selection of the right VPS service for a
location, and many others. We introduce the concept of federated
image-based localization and provide reference solutions for managing and merging data across maps without sharing private data.},

abstract = {CCAnalyzer is a recent proposal for a congestion control algorithm (CCA) classifier to measure the deployment of congestion control algorithms in the Internet today by creating a controlled bottleneck and monitoring bottleneck queue occupancy between third-party websites and a controlled receiver. However, this work was designed for web traffic, whereas most internet traffic today is video streaming. Video streaming applications pose additional challenges in CCA classification due to the interactions between adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms and CCAs. In this work, we present VCCAnalyzer, which addresses these challenges by carefully selecting bottleneck bandwidth rates to minimize ABR interference and applying interpolation and smoothing techniques to create classifiable queue occupancy traces. VCCAnalyzer achieves 100\% accuracy, higher accuracy than other approaches in video classification. To demonstrate the efficacy of VCCAnalyzer, we conduct a measurement study examining the CCA deployment across major streaming platforms, including Disney+, Hulu, Twitch, and other commonly visited websites. Our findings reveal some variations in congestion control strategies between these services. Our results demonstrate that VCCAnalyzer can effectively classify CCAs in video environments.},
