    abstract = {Renewable energy is becoming an important power source for data centers, especially with the zero-carbon waste pledges made by big cloud providers. However, one of the main challenges of renewable energy sources is the high variability of power produced. Traditional approaches such as batteries or transmitting to the grid fall short on scale, overhead, or "green-ness". We propose Virtual Battery: instead of adapting the availability of power to match the computation demand we shift computational demand to meet the availability of power. Virtual batteries shift demand by requiring applications to either be flexible and delay-tolerant or proactively migrating to where power is (going to be) available. We show that using multiple virtual battery sites in combination can meet the needs of modern applications. Moreover, we show how an intelligent network and power aware co-scheduler can not only provide availability despite variability but also help mitigate migration related network overhead by over 30\\% in total and 4.2x at peak.},
