    abstract = "Various trends are reshaping content delivery on the Internet: the explosive growth of traffic due to video, users' increasing expectations for higher quality of experience (QoE), and the proliferation of server capacity from a variety of sources (e.g., cloud computing, content provider-owned datacenters, and ISP-owned CDNs). In order to meet the scale and quality demands imposed by users, content providers have started to spread demand across a variety of CDNs using a broker. Brokers break many traditional CDN assumptions (e.g., unexpected traffic skew, significant variance in demand over short timescales, etc.). Through an analysis of data from a leading broker and a leading CDN, we show the potential challenges and opportunities that brokers impart on content delivery. We take the first steps towards improvement through a redesigned broker-CDN interface.",
