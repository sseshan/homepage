    abstract = "Modern content delivery networks (CDNs) allow their customers (i.e., operators of web services) to customize the processing of requests by uploading and executing code at the edges of the CDN's network. To achieve scale, CDNs have forgone heavyweight virtualization techniques. Instead, all requests often execute within the same OS or even process. However, performance interference may arise when these requests have differing demands on multiple system resources. In this paper, we study the sources of performance interference based on workloads from real customers, identify the lack of multi-resource fairness as the culprit, and show that existing schedulers available in commodity OSs are insufficient to enforce fairness between customers.We then design Sandpaper, a new and practical multi-resource request scheduler for mitigating performance interference in CDN edge environments. Sandpaper enforces fairness despite constraints, such as sitting within the application runtime and running atop the OS's underlying resource schedulers. By leveraging key insights about the differences between theoretical system models and real systems, Sandpaper bridges the trade-off between resource utilization and multi-resource fairness that plagues existing schedulers. We implement Sandpaper atop Varnish, an open-source CDN edge proxy, and show that it mitigates performance interference while maintaining high resource utilization and with little performance overhead.",
