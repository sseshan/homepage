    abstract = "Video viewership over the Internet is rising rapidly, and market predictions suggest that video will comprise over 90\\% of Internet traffic in the next few years. At the same time, there have been signs that the Content Delivery Network (CDN) infrastructure is being stressed by ever-increasing amounts of video traffic. To meet these growing demands, the CDN infrastructure must be designed, provisioned and managed appropriately. Federated telco-CDNs and hybrid P2P-CDNs are two content delivery infrastructure designs that have gained significant industry attention recently. We observed several user access patterns that have important implications to these two designs in our unique dataset consisting of 30 million video sessions spanning around two months of video viewership from two large Internet video providers. These include partial interest in content, regional interests, temporal shift in peak load and patterns in evolution of interest. We analyze the impact of our findings on these two designs by performing a large scale measurement study. Surprisingly, we find significant amount of synchronous viewing behavior for Video On Demand (VOD) content, which makes hybrid P2P-CDN approach feasible for VOD and suggest new strategies for CDNs to reduce their infrastructure costs. We also find that federation can significantly reduce telco-CDN provisioning costs by as much as 95\\%.",
