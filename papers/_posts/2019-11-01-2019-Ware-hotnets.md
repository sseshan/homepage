    abstract = "The Internet community faces an explosion in new congestion control algorithms such as Copa, Sprout, PCC, and BBR. In this paper, we discuss considerations for deploying new algorithms on the Internet. While past efforts have focused on achieving 'fairness'or 'friendliness' between new algorithms and deployed algorithms, we instead advocate for an approach centered on quantifying and limiting harm caused by the new algorithm on the status quo. We argue that a harm-based approach is more practical, more future proof, and handles a wider range of quality metrics than traditional notions of fairness and friendliness.",
