    abstract = "Increasingly, proposals for new datacenter networking fabrics employ some form of traffic scheduling---often to avoid congestion, mitigate queuing delays, or avoid timeouts. Fundamentally, practical implementations require estimating upcoming traffic demand. Unfortunately, as our results show, it is difficult to accurately predict demand in typical datacenter applications more than a few milliseconds ahead of time. We explore the impact of errors in demand estimation on traffic scheduling in circuit-switched networks. We show that even relatively small estimation errors such as shifting the arrival time of at most 30\\% of traffic by a few milliseconds can lead to suboptimal schedules that dramatically reduce network efficiency. Existing systems cope by provisioning extra capacity---either on each circuit, or through the addition of a separate packet-switched fabric. We show through simulation that indirect traffic routing is a powerful technique for recovering from the inefficiencies of suboptimal scheduling under common datacenter workloads, performing as well as networks with 16\\% extra circuit bandwidth or a packet switch with 6\\% of the circuit bandwidth.",
