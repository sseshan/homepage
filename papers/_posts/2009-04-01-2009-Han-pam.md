    abstract = "Many previous studies have examined the placement of access points (APs) to improve the community's understanding of the deployment and behavioral characteristics of wireless networks. A key implicit assumption in these studies is that one can estimate the AP location accurately from wardriving-like measurements. However, existing localization algorithms exhibit high error because they over-simplify the complex nature of signal propagation. In this work, we propose a novel approach that localizes APs using directional information derived from local signal strength variations. Our algorithm only uses signal strength information, and improves localization accuracy over existing techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm is robust to the sampling biases and non-uniform shadowing, which are common in wardriving measurements.",
