    abstract = "Over the last two decades, several algorithms have been proposed to infer the type of relationship between Autonomous Systems (ASes). While the recent works have achieved increasingly higher accuracy, there has not been a systematic study on the uncertainty of AS relationship inference. In this paper, we analyze the factors contributing to this uncertainty and introduce a new paradigm to explicitly model the uncertainty and reflect it in the inference result. We also present UNARI, an exemplary algorithm implementing this paradigm, that leverages a novel technique to capture the interdependence of relationship inference across AS links.",
