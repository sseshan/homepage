    abstract = "Recent congestion control research has focused on purpose-built algorithms designed for the special needs of specific applications. Often, limited testing before deploying a CCA results in unforeseen and hard-to-debug performance issues due to the complex ways a CCA interacts with other existing CCAs and diverse network environments. We present CC-Fuzz, an automated framework that uses genetic search algorithms to generate adversarial network traces and traffic patterns for stress-testing CCAs. Initial results include CC-Fuzz automatically finding a bug in BBR that causes it to stall permanently, and automatically discovering the well-known low-rate TCP attack, among other things.",
