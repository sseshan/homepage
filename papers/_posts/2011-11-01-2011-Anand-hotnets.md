    abstract = "Motivated by limitations in today's host-based IP network architecture, recent studies have proposed clean-slate network architectures centered around alternative first-class principals, such as content, services, or users. However, much like the host-centric IP design, elevating one principal type above others hinders communication between other principals and inhibits the network's capability to evolve. Our work presents the eXpressive Internet Architecture (XIA), an architecture with native support for multiple principals and the ability to evolve its functionality to accommodate new, as yet unforeseen, principals over time. XIA also provides intrinsic security: communicating entities validate that their underlying intent was satisfied correctly without relying on external databases or configuration.In this paper, we focus on core architectural issues in the XIA data plane. We outline key design requirements relating to native support for multiple principals and intrinsic security. We then use case studies to demonstrate how the XIA design facilitates evolvability and flexibility.",
