    abstract = "Various trends are reshaping Internet video delivery: exponential growth in video traffic, rising expectations of high video quality of experience (QoE), and the proliferation of varied content delivery network (CDN) deployments (e.g., cloud computing-based, content provider-owned datacenters, and ISP-owned CDNs). More fundamentally though, content providers are shifting delivery from a single CDN to multiple CDNs, through the use of a content broker. Brokers have been shown to invalidate many traditional delivery assumptions (e.g., shifting traffic invalidates short- and long-term traffic prediction) by not communicating their decisions with CDNs. In this work, we analyze these problems using data from a CDN and a broker. We examine the design space of potential solutions, finding that a marketplace design (inspired by advertising exchanges) potentially provides interesting tradeoffs. A marketplace allows all CDNs to profit on video delivery through fine-grained pricing and optimization, where CDNs learn risk-adverse bidding strategies to aid in traffic prediction. We implement a marketplace-based system (which we dub Video Delivery eXchange or VDX) in CDN and broker data-driven simulation, finding significant improvements in cost and data-path distance.",
