<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
We present a means of containing Wi-Fi coverage to physical boundaries
that are meaningful to users. We call it geo-fencing. Our approach is
based on directional antennas, and our motivation is to provide wireless
access and privacy models that are a natural fit with user expectations.
To evaluate geo-fencing, we use measurements from an indoor testbed of
Wi-Fi nodes and APs with electronically-steerable directional antennas. We
find that by combining directionality, power control and coding across
multiple APs, we are able to successfully confine Wi-Fi coverage to
clients located within target regions of varying shapes and sizes; we can
select between nodes located as close as five feet from each other.
